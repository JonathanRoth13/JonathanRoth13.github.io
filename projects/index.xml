      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the following scenario several times:
My family and I have a vacation of some sort and we each take pictures throughout the entire length of the trip. Afterwards, we share them by uploading them to a shared server.

Organizing the photos afterwards can be tedious because the photos are often not sorted in chronological order.</description>
