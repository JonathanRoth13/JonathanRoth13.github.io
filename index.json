[{"content":"Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered the following scenario several times:\nMy family and I have a vacation of some sort and we each take pictures throughout the entire length of the trip. Afterwards, we share them by uploading them to a shared server. However, all of the photos are all out of order because different phones and cameras use different conventions for naming images. Organizing the photos afterwards can be tedious because the photos are often not sorted in chronological order.\nModern operating systems allow you to sort any file by name or by the date that the file was created but that date refers to the current machine (i.e. when you transferred the files from your phone to your computer) and not when the image was created by the camera. Although some files contain date information in the name, for example \u0026ldquo;IMG_20211014_175621.jpg\u0026rdquo;, not all of them do. There is no good way to sort images using only a file manager.\nFortunately, most image formats (eg jpg, png, heic, nef) allow the camera to include metadata such as the data that the image was taken along with the actual image itself. Bumbling is a tool that uses that metadata to rename images so that they are in chronological order.\nNecessity is the mother of invention. I designed bumbling to organize photos from an arbitrary amount of sources (ie phones). This makes creating a photo album much easier. I can choose the best pictures from an event without searching everywhere to see if there are any more. I often leave the date prefix and give the photo a friendly name, for example IMG_0864.HEIC \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 2021-12-03_xmas-tree.HEIC.\nSource Code available here\nTutorial Here are some photos taken by an IPhone.\n$ ls IMG_0864.HEIC IMG_0928.HEIC IMG_0930.HEIC IMG_0931.HEIC IMG_0933.HEIC IMG_0937.HEIC IMG_0938.HEIC IMG_0939.HEIC IMG_0946.HEIC IMG_0947.HEIC We could include the date in the filename.\n$ bumbling . .
